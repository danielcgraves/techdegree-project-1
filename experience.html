        <h2>Previous Work</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the home page, I have been one of the top guitar teachers at the <a href="https://www.ontrackguitar.com" target="_blank">On Track Music Guitar School</a> for nearly 10 years now. Through the years I have had other side jobs as well! I have been a barista, an Amazon delivery driver, a rideshare driver, and more!</p>
        <p>I have also been put into positions leadership at my current job and other organizations I have been a part of. I was <i>instrumental</i> (pun intended) in the launch of <a href="https://www.redeeminglifeutah.org" target="_blank">Redeeming Life Church</a> where I was in charge of organizing a team and leading the music every Sunday.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>I graduated from Intermountain Christian High School in 2011. From there I went directly into the music program at Salt Lake Community College. I pursued music for a couple of years, including becoming my decision to become a guitar teacher and then I decided to switch things up and go into the Business Management program as well. Although I never got my degree in either of these programs I gained a lot of experience and learned a lot of valuable information and life lessons.</p>
          <p>Now I am currently enrolled in the Front End Web Developer Techdegree program with Team Treehouse. I have dabbled with HTML and CSS in the past but now I want to get serious and hone a new skillset. I plan to complete this Front End Web Developer certificate and then move forward into the Full Stack JavaScript program. These are my current ambitions but I know that my learning won't stop there. I'm so excited to see where this journey will take me!</p>
